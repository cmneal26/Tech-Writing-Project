Dont put content in the template, unless there is a special reason for it. Put the content in `our-mission/index.md`

We want authoring to be a pleasant experience. If we can write more in markdown, less in html/other stuff, that will help us focus on the content and the experience of writing.

What you are seeing displayed. The content below this line has been injected into the template, and uses `our-mission/index.md`

There is a safe filter applied to the template's injected content. That makes sure dangerous content isn't injected.

<p>The team members of Free Free API Education Inc. noted an alarming trend. The difference between the least well off and the well-to-do is growing, and part of the explanation for that has to do with the fact that wealth tends to correlate with access to the technologies that have become so crucial to our way of life in this modern world. These crucial technologies give rise to a host of direct tech and supporting jobs, jobs that may be better suited to some persons than others, as a viable way of life.</p>
<p>However, the least well off often don’t have the opportunity to gain exposure toward what interacting with those technologies is really like, so they don’t know if they represent viable options and career paths. And this divide is growing wider. The people with more access to technologies get the better jobs, and the wealth gap grows.</p>
<p>We here at Free Free API Education aim to help with this problem by providing more opportunities for the economically underprivileged to interact and learn through our on-site modules. And if you happen to be a kid, and not an adult, and you get tired of learning after awhile and want to take a break? Go right ahead and play a fun game of Snakes and Mongooses on the ‘Kids’ page. If you’re an adult and want to try? Go right ahead!</p>
