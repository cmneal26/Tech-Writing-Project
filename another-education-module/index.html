<h3>We use our Free Free API Education data-driven technology to rebrand perry on: a dialogue on personal identity and immortality</h3>

<h2 id="introduction" tabindex="-1">Introduction <a class="direct-link" href="#introduction" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h2>
<p>There is a lot of good content that would be more motivating, approachable and accessible if it incorporated elements of gamification and lots of interesting visuals. Childrens books and comics have the right idea. Keep the text content under control, and introduce images, colors, contrast: all the usual Markdown/CSS bells and whistles that make what might otherwise be a dull or confusing experience a bit more lively and effective when it comes to information transfer.</p>
<p>As the technical writing and content team for the Free Free API Education non-profit, Team Fetching is naturally a team of Markdown masters. With their specialized proprietary technological approach, they can take even the most abstruse text and rebirth it in accordance with Free Free API Education's &quot;simple, clear, and effective&quot; principle, best expressed in the way the core of our lessons focus on only the most critical and practical steps. As the inaugural demonstration of our methodology, we will take a text-dense document with valuable content, and enhance that content in a way that allows it to reach its full potential.</p>
<p>Before we begin our makeover, perhaps we should take a moment to peruse the text we'll be augmenting.</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>Let's keep this simple. Not too many rules. And every style rule has to have an associated justification. Also, the justification doesn't always have to be directly tied to information transfer. Different visual and structural effects can induce very distinct experiences. And sometimes a mixed bag has the best effect. Think of the mixed nuts and mixed candies that are popular. The experience of eating a bowl of mixed nuts is very different from the experience of eating one kind of nut. And the experience of eating homogeneous candies is very different from the experience of eating mixed candies.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This style guide is meant to help us produce a more impactful reading experience, while respecting our &quot;simple, clear, and effective&quot; educational principle. Because of the nature of this particular heavy-text document (as an exploratory dialogue), we should acknowledge that the goal of our visual effects isn't necessarily to appeal to a task-based orientation you might find in a car manual. We want to enhance the content by making the reader experience new ideas in novel ways. And so considerations of content and considerations of how that content makes the user feel ought not to be separated. For example, to ease the existential tension of this dialogue, perhaps we should re-apply the soothing nature light theming we implemented for our &quot;Fetching&quot; educational module. And to take this a step further, we can replace the characters in the story with similar but comical representations of them that happen to be reflection-capable animals.</p>

<li><strong>Rule One</strong>: Color-Code The speakers. If there are three speakers, we should see three differently colored names.
<ul>
<li><strong>Rule One Justification</strong>: in traditional text-heavy documents, it can be difficult for the reader to tell the interlocutors apart, and so it makes it more difficult to focus on whats important: the ideas. We attend to colors. So, if a speaker has a color, then the cognitive overhead of keeping track of who is who will be negligible.</li>
