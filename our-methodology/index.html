<p>Most traditional outreach programs fall short of the aspirations of their founders. Whether it's lack of funding, poor organization, or a half-hearted approach, the outcomes of these programs rarely live up to their potential.</p>
<p>Online education platforms simply don't have the support network and structure in place to offer the guidance many learners need to make tech approachable -- not to mention access to a networked computer.</p>
<p>Enter Free Free API Education. A new kind of non-profit. We recruit cohorts of curious learners from economically marginalized communities, and we teach them practical tech skills while instilling confidence and showing them how to do cool things.</p>

<p>We implement POUR principle at every level of our program to make sure all of our learners are successful.</p>

<li>
<p><strong>Perceivable</strong><br>
We don't just put our learners in a room with some computers and call it a day. Our program is rigorous, so we make sure our learners perceive why what we're teaching them is valuable. The magic of APIs doesn't have to be limited to just a priveleged few.</p>

<p><strong>Operable</strong><br>
We continually refine our approach to bridging the tech gap by iterating on the data we acquire from each of our cohorts.</p>

<p><strong>Understandable</strong><br>
Our &quot;simple, clear, and effective&quot; principle isn't merely limited to our sterling educational content. We employ a full staff of health and wellness experts to help our learners adjust.</p>

<p>We keep detailed records of every graduate of our program. And we use that data to help cut through the fluff and make better organizational decisions. We're continually iterating and improving.</p>
