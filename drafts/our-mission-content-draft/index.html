THIS IS A CONTENT DRAFT FOR THE OUR MISSION Pagetitle: OUR MISSIONabout: branding is important for non-profits. We can work on a draft of the content separately from graphics and how it will appear when we finalize it on our Markdown ‘Our Mission’ Page.where to put the final draft: this content is going to live inside the <a href="http://Markdown.md">Markdown.md</a> page. It’s a plain style page.context: if we keep the content markdown drafts when that makes sense in a draft folder in the repo, we can update content that way kinda independently. This seems like an alternative to the google docs approach. Is this approach any good? Not sure, but it does have the virtue of unifying the work further in the GitHub repo. This tight coupling seems like it might be useful? <a class="direct-link" href="#edit-this-however-you-want.-this-is-a-content-draft-for-the-our-mission-pagetitle:-our-missionabout:-branding-is-important-for-non-profits.-we-can-work-on-a-draft-of-the-content-separately-from-graphics-and-how-it-will-appear-when-we-finalize-it-on-our-markdown-'our-mission'-page.where-to-put-the-final-draft:-this-content-is-going-to-live-inside-the-markdown.md-page.-it's-a-plain-style-page.context:-if-we-keep-the-content-markdown-drafts-when-that-makes-sense-in-a-draft-folder-in-the-repo-we-can-update-content-that-way-kinda-independently.-this-seems-like-an-alternative-to-the-google-docs-approach.-is-this-approach-any-good-not-sure-but-it-does-have-the-virtue-of-unifying-the-work-further-in-the-github-repo.-this-tight-coupling-seems-like-it-might-be-useful" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h2>
<p>CONTENT (paste into our-mission/index.md)</p>
<p>The team members of Free Free API Education Inc. noted an alarming trend. The difference between the least well off and the well-to-do is growing, and part of the explanation for that has to do with the fact that wealth tends to correlate with access to the technologies that have become so crucial to our way of life in this modern world. These crucial technologies give rise to a host of direct tech and supporting jobs, jobs that may be better suited to some persons than others, as a viable way of life.However, the least well off often don’t have the opportunity to gain exposure toward what interacting with those technologies is really like, so they don’t know if they represent viable options and career paths. And this divide is growing wider. The people with more access to technologies get the better jobs, and the wealth gap grows.<br>
We here at Free Free API Education aim to help with this problem by providing more opportunities for the economically underprivileged to interact and learn through our on-site modules. And if you happen to be a kid, and not an adult, and you get tired of learning after awhile and want to take a break? Go right ahead and play a fun game of Snakes and Mongooses on the ‘Kids’ page. If you’re an adult and want to try? Go right ahead!</p>
