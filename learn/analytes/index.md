<p class="analyte-paragraph">The MCL for an analyte represents the RSL for drinking water, whether or not the source comes from a groundwater aquifer. The SSL for each analyte is protective of groundwater. It represents an estimation of how much soil contamination will leak into groundwater, or the dilution factor. For example, if the MCL for an analyte is 0.06 mg/L and the dilution factor is 10, the SSL will be 0.6 mg/L. The MCL-based SSL is generally used for drinking water contamination and the Risk-based SSL is generally used for groundwater that is not connected to drinking water aquifers.</p>

<h3 class="analyte-paragraph">Important Data Limitations</h3>

<p class="analyte-paragraph">This search tool is not a replacement for full site characterization. While the EPA Generic Tables provide a baseline to measure the approximate RSL for a contaminated site, they are not adequate to determine exact RSLs. These will depend on multiple factors relating to location and the extent of contamination present on a property.</p>

<p class="analyte-paragraph">The EPA website to view the full Generic Tables is called "Regional Screening Levels (RSLs) - Generic Tables." Links for the website and the table are listed here:
