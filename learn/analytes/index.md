Important Data Limitations

This search tool is not a replacement for full site characterization. While the EPA Generic Tables provide a baseline to measure the approximate RSL for a contaminated site, they are not adequate to determine exact RSLs. These will depend on multiple factors relating to location and the extent of contamination present on a property.

The EPA website to view the full Generic Tables is called "Regional Screening Levels (RSLs) - Generic Tables." Links for the website and the table are listed here:
